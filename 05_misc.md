**Japanese Anime**

I am an avid fan of Japanese anime. A rather long list of shows I've watched
can be found at my personal 
[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Zelareth) page. Some of
my favorite shows are:

| [Toradora!](https://anilist.co/anime/4224/Toradora) | [Steins;Gate](https://anilist.co/anime/9253/SteinsGate) | [Shakugan no Shana](https://anilist.co/anime/355/Shakugan-no-Shana) | [AnoHana: The Flower We Saw That Day](https://anilist.co/anime/9989/Ano-Hi-Mita-Hana-no-Namae-wo-Bokutachi-wa-Mada-Shiranai) | [Gintama](https://anilist.co/anime/918/Gintama) |

**Gaming**

I am also a lifelong gamer. For online games, I currently mostly play
[Final Fantasy XIV](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/21553560/) or [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/).
My main in FFXIV is a level 80 Gunbreaker and my favorite agent in Valorant
is Cypher.
In general, I play a variety of MMOs and FPS, and I also used to play
[League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/) and was a
closed beta tester in 2009.
I stream [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/prof_zelareth)
inconsistently, but I stream some endgame FFXIV content,
shogi, or
other games.

My favorite studio is FromSoftware, and I am particularly a fan of 
Armored Core and Dark Souls. 
I play many genres of games, but my favorite is JRPGs and my favorite series
is the [Tales of](https://aselia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) series.
I have finished 9 out of the 16 flagship titles to date: 
[Phantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Phantasia), 
[Sympohnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Symphonia),
[Abyss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Abyss), 
[Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Hearts), 
[Graces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Graces), 
[Xillia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Xillia), 
[Xillia 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Xillia_2), 
[Zestiria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Zestiria), 
and [Berseria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Berseria).

**Shogi**

The Japanese variant of chess is known as 
[Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi). 
The primary difference is that captured pieces may be played by the capturing
player during their turn. This leads to exciting endgames which are often
races to capture the opponent's king, and draws are very rare. Although
no longer maintained,
[HIDETCHI's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkz0LVBg0W4&list=PL587865CAE59EB84A)
YouTube channel is the best place for English speakers to learn Shogi.

The best places to play online are
[Shogi Wars](https://shogiwars.heroz.jp/?locale=en) and
[81Dojo](https://81dojo.com/). Both are officially partnered with the
Japanese Shogi Association and your rank in these apps can be made official
through the JSA! The lowest rank that can be certified is 6-kyu after which
the ranks increase with descending numbers; i.e. the next rank is 5-kyu,
then 4-kyu, and so on. After 1-kyu the next rank is 1-dan after which it
counts upwards to 5-dan. You can think of 1-dan as the equivalent of a
"first-degree black belt" in martial arts.

I mostly play on Shogi Wars (10+0 time format) and am currently ranked 2-kyu.
