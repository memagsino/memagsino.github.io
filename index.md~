I am a Research Visiting Assistant Professor in the 
[Department of Mathematics](https://math.osu.edu/)
at the Ohio State University. My research interests include frame theory,
applied harmonic analysis, and
signal and image processing.

I received my PhD in 2018 at the 
[University of Maryland](https://www-math.umd.edu/)
under the guidance of 
[John J. Benedetto](https://www.math.umd.edu/~jjb/). I spent my undergraduate
years at 
[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html), where I
graduated in 2012 with a BS in Mathematics and Japanese Studies.

I am [Filipino-American](http://fanhs-national.org/filam/): my mom is from
[Quezon City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quezon_City) and my dad is from
[Manila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila). My main hobbies are anime
and gaming. If you're curious you can read more [here]({{ site.url }}/misc/)
