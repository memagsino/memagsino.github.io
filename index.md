pure and applied harmonic analysis. In particular, I study frame theory,
optimal line packings, compressive sensing, with applications to areas such
as data science as well as signal and image processing. Here is a link to my
[CV]({{site.url}}/mmagsino_cv.pdf). (Last updated: 10/13/19)

I received my PhD in 2018 at the
