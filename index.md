I am a Research Visiting Assistant Professor in the

applied harmonic analysis. In particular, I study frame theory and its
applications to signal and image processing, data science, compressive sensing,
and optimal line packings.

I received my PhD in 2018 at the

under the guidance of 
[John J. Benedetto](https://www.math.umd.edu/~jjb/). I spent my undergraduate

[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html), where I
graduated in 2012 with a BS in Mathematics and Japanese Studies.

I am from [Franklin Park, NJ](https://goo.gl/maps/FFr7jRkiyjX999x66)
